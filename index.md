What:
-----

This is a weekly meeting for sharing skills and best practices for
scientific computation. In these friendly sessions, peers at all levels
of experience share topics useful in our scientific software development
workflows.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries,
showing off useful features of a scientific library or programming
language you're using, or bringing up a computational problem you're
having.

Where:
-----



This meeting takes place at the [Berkeley Institute for Data
Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu).

Room 190, Doe Library, The University of California - Berkeley


Who:
-----

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to
come to our meetings.


When:
-----


Wednesdays at 4:00pm. While the main talk should occupy less than an hour, the
lightning talks and hacking session can go on until 6:00pm or later. See the [upcoming topics list]({{ site.url }}/upcoming.html)
or the [calendar](http://bit.ly/1cqFKuh)
for the topic for this week.
To keep up with meetings, you will want to
[sign up for the mailing list](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu).



How:
-----

Participating is really easy.
<li>At **4:00pm**, we gather and go through a round of introductions.
New faces are always appearing!</li>
<li>Next, a volunteer will give a **tutorial** or lead a
**discussion** about a
computational topic. This topic can be anything useful, new, or
interesting to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked
up in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, an overview of a
useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.</li>
<li>Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which
are 5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or
question of interest to the group.
**Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a
question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the
place to ask many ears about it at once.
</li>

The Hacker Within relies on peer-driven teaching, so please volunteer to
give one of these talks. To do so, just ping the listhost by email at
[ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu](mailto:ucb-hacker-within@lists.berkeley.edu).


Why:
------


The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail
to make use of current development tools such as unit testing, version
control, automated documentation, and others.


To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best practices for
computational scientific applications. This group is modeled after The
Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and
is now reborn as a collection of such chapters around the world. Each of
the chapters convenes a community of scientists, at all levels of their
education and training, to share their knowledge and best practices in
using computing to accomplish their work.
