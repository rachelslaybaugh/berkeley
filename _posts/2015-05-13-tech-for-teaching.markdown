## Experiences Teaching With The IPython Notebook and Sphinx

Matthew Brett will share some feedback on his experiences using the IPython
notebook and sphinx for 10 weeks (and counting) of heavy use for teaching.

The basic idea is to describe the strange and uncomfortable place where he uses and needs the IPython notebook a lot, but doen't have much fun at all writing lots of text,
re-organizing content, or doing diffs in order to collaborate.
It seems like there may be some middle way that would be very good.  Maybe a little bit like the totally [new rodeo project](https://github.com/yhat/rodeo).
