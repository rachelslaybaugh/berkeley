I ([Matthew](http://matthew.dynevor.org)) am an aged sort-of post-doc working
at the UCB [Brain Imaging Center](http://bic.berkeley.edu/).

## How to use (how not to use) the IPython notebook for teaching

I am teaching a course called [practical
neuroimaging](http://practical-neuroimaging.github.io) at UCB.

The course is half-flipped, in that the students do 30 minutes of reading
before class, and spend about half of the 2 hour class time doing exercises.

Of course we make heavy use of the IPython notebook for the exercises, and
this has worked very well.

But - using IPython for tutorials and reading for the class has been much more
difficult  because it does not yet fit well with static website builders like
Sphinx.

It is still hard to write a lot of complicated text or explanation in the
notebook because the web interface and cell structure make the environment
cumbersome compared to a good text editor.

Others seem to have had the same experience working with the IPython notebook
as an interactive code editor - see the very new [rodeo project](
http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/introducing-rodeo.html).

Maybe, by sharing our experiences, we can help to work out some solution that
uses the IPython machinery, that is yet closer to perfection.
