## Description

Kaggle is a data science platform where data scientists from all over the world work together and compete in real-world machine learning challenges. These public data sets cover a wide array of interesting problems from diagnosing eye problems based on images of the retina to recommending coupons to users who visit a site. On Tuesday, we will explore the machine learning process in the context of competitions and how Kaggle is becoming a really good starting point for machine learning enthusiasts to collaborate and learn new things.
