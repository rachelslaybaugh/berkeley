## Attending

About 20 people.

## Anders Priest

Anders is a graduate student in nuclear engineering at Berkeley.

## Microcontrollers

Circuit boards, arduinos, Raspberry Pi's, oh my! Microcontrollers and similar 
digital devices enable you to sense and control the physical world using 
nothing but your programming skills.

### Notes

Microcontrollers are small computers that range in size and scale. Some are more
sophisticated than others.

They are found in a variety of devices - cars, microwaves, remote controls, digital
clocks, etc. They are also used in industry and medicine.

The Arduino produces its own IDE, which is fairly simple to use. The two necessary
functions are `setup()` and `loop()`. Programs have to be written on a separate
computer, however.

The Raspberry Pi is somewhat more sophisticated and runs a stripped-down version
of Linux. You can do things like run Python scripts on the RPi.

Components to use with microcontrollers include:

- the usual analog suspects (wires, resistors, etc.)
- sensors (accelerometers, thermistors, joysticks, etc.)
- "shields" are devices to mount on Arduino microcontrollers (for ethernet, WiFi, etc.)

The nuclear engineering department is working on a dosimeter network using
Raspberry Pi devices.

The Internet has a lot of great resources if you're interested in working with and
learning about microcontrollers.

Today's presentation was brought to us on a Raspberry Pi! Neat.

## Lightning Talks 

None today.
