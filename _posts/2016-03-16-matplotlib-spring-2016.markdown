## Tenzing Joshi bio

I am a post-doc in the Applied Nuclear Physics Program at LBL.


## Nick Swanson-Hysell bio

I am an Assistant Professor of Earth and Planetary Science here at UC Berkeley. My research is focused on reconstructing conditions on the ancient Earth with a particular focus on using magnetic data from rocks to determine the past positions of continents. You can learn more at [my website](http://www.swanson-hysell.org/). I seek to us tools that facilitate open and reproducible data analysis. You can find [me
](https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell) and my [research group](https://github.com/Swanson-Hysell-group) on Github.
