## Rachel Slaybaugh

Rachel Slaybaugh is an Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the 
University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, Prof. Slaybaugh's research 
program is based in computational methods and applied to existing and advanced 
nuclear reactors, nuclear non-proliferation and security, and shielding 
applications. She received a BS in Nuclear Engineering from Penn State in 2006 
where she served as a licensed nuclear reactor operator. Dr. Slaybaugh went on 
to the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison to earn an MS in 2008 and a PhD in 
2011 in Nuclear Engineering and Engineering Physics along with a certificate in
 Energy Analysis and Policy. For her PhD she researched acceleration methods for
 massively parallel deterministic neutron transport codes. Dr. Slaybaugh then 
worked with hybrid (deterministic-Monte Carlo) methods for shielding 
applications at Bettis Laboratory while teaching at the University of Pittsburgh
 as an adjunct faculty member. Throughout her career Dr. Slaybaugh has been 
engaged in software carpentry education and training; she also contributes to 
the open source project [PyNE](http://pyne.io). Prof. Slaybaugh was awarded the
