## The Python Olympics

The fastest way to learn a programming language is to use it. So why not turn that into a game? 

All levels of experience welcome. We have Python puzzles for advanced coders and beginners alike.

This will also be the world debut of a new kind of interactive IPython Notebook designed for group coding games.

See you at the games!
