Approximately 35 people


## Kevin Koy

Kevin is the Executive Director of the Berkeley Institute for Data Science 
(BIDS). He was previously executive director at the Geospatial Innovation 
Facility (GIF).

## Geospatial Data
### Resources
To get help beyond this talk, visit the Berkeley [Geospatial Innovation Facility](http://gif.berkeley.edu). They have resource guides, office hours, workshops, and more.

Data:
- [Berkeley GIF resources for finding data](http://gif.berkeley.edu/resources/data.html)
- [Administrative Boundaries](http://www.gadm.org)
- [Climate data](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu)
- [Open Street Map](http://openstreetmap.org)

Tools:
- [Quantum GIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/): open source, multiplatform geospatial software

### Notes

There are two general types of GIS data. These are:
- Vector data (in shapefiles, for example) 
- and Raster data (in pixels, numbered cells).

Where to find Geospatial Data?

For the demo, there are a few places where the data will be downloaded from:

[http://gadm.org](http://gadm.org)
[http://prism.oregonstate.edu](http://prism.oregonstate.edu)
[http://www.openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org)

Kevin demonstrated using QGIS (an open source 
alternative to ARCGIS).  [http://www.qgis.org/en/site/](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/)

He also showed us how to publish our map data on the webservice Cartodb at 
[https://cartodb.com](https://cartodb.com).

## Lightning Talks 

## Aji : TerraView

Aji shared [TerraView](http://terraview.io:8080/landing), a node.js app which 
can show information about air quality.
It has many layers, a straighforward map, using open street map. But, on top of 
it, using node.js, there's an open source package called leaflet which allows 
lots of extra layers to the map. In real time, new values are updated.
