## Sven Chilton

Bio

## Matthias Bussonnier

Post Doc in BIDS, mostly wotking on Jupyter and IPython. 


## Discussion: Topic Description

WE'll discuss a bit on advance Python, context manager, dunder methods, and a lot of things that might not be good idea to do in production but are fun to play with. 

If tiem permit a little bit of AST. 

[here](https://gist.github.com/Carreau/b8ed0853ab93a1943319) is the notebook I used for the various example. 


## Lightning Talks

Finally, there will be a time for a couple of **Lightning Talks**, which are 
5-10 minute blasts of information about a particular topic or question of 
interest to the group.  This topic can be anything useful, new, or interesting 
to scientists who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked up 
in your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, a 
quick demo of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy learning.  
**Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a question to the 
group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the place to ask many ears 
about it at once.
