## Conversion to Python 3

Not everybody may be aware, but Legacy Python 2 is reaching end of life in 2020, and
it's well beyond time to move to Python 3, which is a much better language.

I'll show some of the reason why you do not want to stay on Legacy Python, and
what are the paths you can take to migrate your codebase (including notebooks !)
to Python 3.

I'll also show off some Python 3 fancy packages !
